# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation

## Overview
This Laravel application now includes a complete Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) authentication. Users can enable 2FA to add an extra layer of security to their accounts.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Added 2FA fields to users table:
  - `two_factor_enabled` (boolean): Whether 2FA is enabled
  - `two_factor_secret` (text): Encrypted secret key for TOTP
  - `two_factor_recovery_codes` (text): JSON array of recovery codes
  - `two_factor_confirmed_at` (timestamp): When 2FA was confirmed

### 2. User Model Methods
- `hasTwoFactorEnabled()`: Check if 2FA is enabled and confirmed
- `getTwoFactorQrCodeAttribute()`: Generate QR code for authenticator app setup
- `generateRecoveryCodes()`: Generate 8 recovery codes
- `verifyTwoFactorCode($code)`: Verify TOTP or recovery code
- `isValidRecoveryCode($code)`: Check and consume recovery codes

### 3. Profile Controller Methods
- `enableTwoFactor()`: Generate secret and QR code
- `confirmTwoFactor()`: Verify setup and enable 2FA
- `disableTwoFactor()`: Disable 2FA with password confirmation
- `generateRecoveryCodes()`: Generate new recovery codes

### 4. 2FA Challenge System
- `TwoFactorController`: Handle login-time 2FA verification
- `EnsureTwoFactorAuthentication` middleware: Force 2FA verification
- Challenge view with authenticator and recovery code options

### 5. Routes
- `POST /profile/two-factor/enable`: Enable 2FA setup
- `POST /profile/two-factor/confirm`: Confirm 2FA setup
- `POST /profile/two-factor/disable`: Disable 2FA
- `POST /profile/two-factor/recovery-codes`: Generate new recovery codes
- `GET /two-factor/challenge`: Show 2FA verification form
- `POST /two-factor/verify`: Verify 2FA code during login

## How to Use

### For Users

#### Enabling 2FA:
1. Go to Profile → Security tab
2. Click "Enable 2FA" button
3. Scan QR code with authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
4. Enter 6-digit verification code
5. Save the displayed recovery codes in a secure location

#### Disabling 2FA:
1. Go to Profile → Security tab
2. Click "Disable 2FA" button
3. Enter your password to confirm
4. 2FA will be disabled

#### Login with 2FA:
1. Login with username/password as usual
2. If 2FA is enabled, you'll be redirected to 2FA verification page
3. Enter 6-digit code from your authenticator app
4. Alternatively, use a recovery code if needed

### For Developers

#### Adding 2FA Middleware to Routes:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', '2fa'])->group(function () {
    // Protected routes that require 2FA verification
});
```

#### Checking 2FA Status:
```php
if (auth()->user()->hasTwoFactorEnabled()) {
    // User has 2FA enabled
}
```

## Security Features
- Recovery codes are one-time use and removed after consumption
- TOTP codes are time-based and expire quickly
- Secret keys are encrypted in database
- Password confirmation required for disabling 2FA
- Session-based 2FA verification (doesn't require re-verification on every request)

## Dependencies
- `pragmarx/google2fa-laravel`: TOTP generation and verification
- `pragmarx/google2fa-qrcode`: QR code generation for easy setup

## Configuration
Configuration is stored in `config/google2fa.php` (published from the package).

## Database Migration
Run `php artisan migrate` to add the 2FA fields to your users table.

## Testing
1. Enable 2FA on a test account
2. Test login process with authenticator app
3. Test recovery codes functionality
4. Test disabling 2FA

## UI Components
- Modern, responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Interactive modals for 2FA setup
- Clear status indicators (enabled/disabled)
- Recovery codes display with security warnings
- Mobile-friendly authenticator code input

The 2FA system is now fully functional and ready for production use!
