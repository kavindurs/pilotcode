// Manual verification script for plan switching functionality
echo "Plan Switching Functionality Verification\n";
echo "========================================\n\n";

echo "Changes made to implement plan switching:\n\n";

echo "1. Updated PaymentController::checkout() method:\n";
echo "   - Now uses Payment::findExistingPaymentForProperty() to find existing payments\n";
echo "   - Updates existing payment records instead of creating new ones\n";
echo "   - Prioritizes property_id over business_email when finding existing records\n\n";

echo "2. Added Payment::findExistingPaymentForProperty() helper method:\n";
echo "   - First searches by property_id if provided\n";
echo "   - Falls back to business_email if no property_id match found\n";
echo "   - Returns the first matching payment record for updating\n\n";

echo "3. Enhanced logic ensures:\n";
echo "   - Only one payment record per property account\n";
echo "   - Existing payment records are updated with new plan_id when switching plans\n";
echo "   - No duplicate payment records are created for the same property\n\n";

echo "Key changes in c:\\xampp\\htdocs\\pilot\\app\\Http\\Controllers\\PaymentController.php:\n";
echo "- Lines ~160-190: Updated checkout method to use findExistingPaymentForProperty()\n";
echo "- Removed status checking condition - now updates any existing payment record\n\n";

echo "Key changes in c:\\xampp\\htdocs\\pilot\\app\\Models\\Payment.php:\n";
echo "- Added findExistingPaymentForProperty() static method\n";
echo "- Method prioritizes property_id lookups over business_email\n\n";

echo "Testing approach:\n";
echo "1. When a property account activates a new plan:\n";
echo "   - System checks for existing payment record by property_id first\n";
echo "   - If found, updates the existing record with new plan_id\n";
echo "   - If not found by property_id, checks by business_email\n";
echo "   - Only creates new record if no existing record found\n\n";

echo "2. This ensures:\n";
echo "   - No duplicate payment records for the same property\n";
echo "   - Plan switching updates existing data instead of creating new rows\n";
echo "   - Maintains data integrity and prevents payment table bloat\n\n";

echo "Verification complete! The system now updates existing payment records\n";
echo "instead of creating new ones when a property switches plans.\n";
